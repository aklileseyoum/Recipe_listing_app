                    <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                    <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>Lettuce, tomato, onion (optional toppings)</li>

                <span class="font-bold text-2xl">Instructions:</span>
                <ol>
                    <li>1, Divide the one-pound portion of ground beef into four equal portions. Shape each portion into a well-formed patty, ensuring uniform thickness. Generously season both sides of the patties with salt and freshly ground black pepper, enhancing the flavor profile.</li>
                    <li>2, Initiate the culinary process by preheating a grill or a stovetop pan, setting the heat to medium-high. Gently place the seasoned patties onto the cooking surface, allowing them to sizzle and develop a rich sear. Allow approximately 3 to 4 minutes of cooking time per side, adjusting as necessary to achieve the desired degree of doneness.</li>
                    <li>3, During the final minute of cooking, meticulously lay a slice of aged cheddar cheese atop each patty, allowing its decadent creaminess to envelop the meat and gently melt.</li>
                    <li>4, Elevate the taste and texture of the culinary creation by toasting the high-quality hamburger buns to a delightful shade of light golden brown. Utilize the grill or a trusty toaster to execute this step with precision.</li>
                    <li>5, The harmonious assembly of the double burger involves placing a meticulously cooked patty adorned with the molten cheddar atop the lower half of the toasted bun. For an added dimension of taste and vibrancy, consider layering the ensemble with vibrant lettuce leaves, slices of succulent ripe tomato, and delicately sliced onion rings. Crown the creation with the upper half of the toasted bun, sealing the symphony of flavors within.</li>
                    <li>6, Culminate the gastronomic experience by presenting the double burgers alongside optional condiments that tantalize the palate. Offer premium ketchup, renowned for its balance of sweetness and tanginess, alongside the refined complexity of Dijon mustard and the indulgent creaminess of high-quality mayonnaise.</li>
